# nosql-challenge

# Introduction
Within this project I am given the evaluations of various restaurants across the United kingdom and a rating based on their hygiene. I will be evaluating the data provided to help show journalists and food critics where they should best focus their effort for their future articles.

# Packages
To get started with this project we are going to be using python. We will want to import the pymongo, pprint, pandas, and matplotlib packages to get our desired results.

# Overview
We are helping Eat Safe, Love answer some questions that will help them determine which restaurants they will want to visit in the future and which they will want to avoid. We will be looking at the hygiene, structural and confidence in management scores to determine which locations the journalists will want to visit.
